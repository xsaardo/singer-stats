[Verse 1: Nick Carter]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

[Chorus: All]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake

[Verse 2: <b>Brian Littrell</b>]
<b>Now I can see that we've fallen apart</b>
<b>From the way that it used to be, yeah</b>
No matter the distance
I want you to know

[Bridge: <i>AJ McLean</i>, Howie Dorough]
<i>Don't wanna hear you say</i>
Ain't nothing but a heartache
<i>Ain't nothing but a mistake</i>
I want it that way

[Outro: <b><i>Nick Carter</i></b> & Brian Littrell]
<b><i>You are my fire</i></b>
The one desire
